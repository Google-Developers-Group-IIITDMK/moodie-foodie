# üçΩÔ∏è Moodie-Foodie: IIITDM Campus Food Recommendation Engine

**Moodie-Foodie** is an **intelligent, mobile-first Single-Page Application (SPA)** designed to optimize food selection for the IIITDM Kurnool community. It transforms the "what to eat?" dilemma into a swift, efficient decision by providing **data-driven, customized, and budget-aware meal suggestions** from campus canteens and the daily Mess schedule.

## üß† System Intelligence & Architecture

The core of the application is the `suggestFood()` function, which executes proprietary JavaScript logic for advanced filtering and prioritization:

1.  **Intelligent Price Inference:** Dynamically sets a contextually relevant **default budget** (e.g., ‚Çπ50-‚Çπ150 for "Heavy" mood) if price bounds are omitted, ensuring successful search results.

2.  **Best Value Algorithm:** Prioritizes **Substantial Meals** over snacks and selects the cheapest substantial option that correlates with the user's selected **Mood**.

3.  **Unbiased Dual Suggestion:** When **"Both (Veg/Non-Veg)"** is selected, the system calculates and prominently displays the best value **Vegetarian** pick and the best value **Non-Vegetarian** pick concurrently.

4.  **Specific Query Override:** If a dish name is entered, price bounds are automatically ignored, simplifying the search experience.
